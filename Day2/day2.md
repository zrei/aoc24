<h1>Part 1</h1>
Iterate through the line, storing whether we should check for an increase or decrease. Determine if the line is valid.

<h1>Part 2</h1>
Brute forced this one by first checking if the line was valid, and if it wasn't, checking if the line was valid when removing each entry. This reused part 1's code and just skipped the removed entry in the check.
