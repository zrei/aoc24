<h1>Part 1</h1>
Initially misunderstood this one as `XMAS` being able to change direction instead of only being in one direction. Iterated through the matrix, checking each position for a XMAS in any of the possible directions.

<h1>Part 2</h1>
Same as part 1, I iterated through the matrix and checked each position for a XMAS cross, assuming the current point is the top left of the cross.
