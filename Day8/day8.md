<h1>Part 1</h1>
For each possible antenna character, I found all their positions on the grid and then compared each possible combination with each other to find possible antinodes.

<h1>Part 2</h1>
Reused part 1's code and added a boolean flag to handle extension for antinode positions. Also didn't understand the thing about the antennas themselves initially, but just checked the number of antennas of each character and added them as antinode positions if there is more than one.
