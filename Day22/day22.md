<h1>Part 2</h1>
Created a struct that represents a sequence of changes. 

For each buyer, iterate through the secret numbers and calculate the changes. Iterating through the changes, add the number of bananas for that sequence if it's the first time it occurs for the buyer. A global unordered map is used to store the total number of bananas for each sequence.

The maximum number of bananas can be calculated at the end.
