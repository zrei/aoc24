Needs to print 2.
This requres running the 5,5

2,4,1,2,7,5,1,7,4,4,0,3,5,5,3,0

2, 4 first runs A % 8 into B, keeping only the last 3 bits (this is what matters initially) --> B is a 3 bit number

1, 2 does B XOR 2 --> B is still a 3 bit number

7, 5 performs A / (2 ^ B) and stores into C --> this could mean C is > than a 3 bit number but that would create more 1s so this is still a 3 bit number

1, 7 performs B XOR 7 into B

4, 4 performs B XOR C into B

0, 3 peforms A / (2 ^ 3) and stores into A

5, 5 performs output B, which MUST BE 2 (this is modulo 8 again so the next three bits for C does not matter)
^ So B XOR C must be equal to 2 which is 010 so first and last bit of B and C must be equal only the middle bit is different

3, 0 does a jump. It needs to jump, so A cannot be 0 at this point which means it must have a 1 bit outside of the 3 bit range
