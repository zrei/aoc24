Advent of Code 2024, done in C++.

File reading was handled centrally by `fileRead.cpp` which returned all lines in the file as a vector of strings. The individual days were then responsible for parsing the input.

Day 12 onwards was done overseas in New Zealand so most of those days were delayed. The flight back home was on Christmas as well so day 25 was majorly delayed.

I needed hints from Reddit for 6 part 2s, which was a vast improvement over last year. Wonder if I got smarter or if it's just the lack of graph problems (lol).
